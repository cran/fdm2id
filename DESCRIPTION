Description: Contains functions to simplify the use of data mining methods (classification, regression, clustering, etc.), for students and beginners in R programming. Various R packages are used and wrappers are built around the main functions, to standardize the use of data mining methods (input/output): it brings a certain loss of flexibility, but also a gain of simplicity. The package name came from the French "Fouille de Données en Master 2 Informatique Décisionnelle".
