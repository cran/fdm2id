\description{
Data were collected on the genus of flea beetle \emph{Chaetocnema}, which contains three species:
\emph{concinna}, \emph{heikertingeri}, and \emph{heptapotamica}.
Measurements were made on the width and angle of the aedeagus of each beetle.
The goal of the original study was to form a classification rule to distinguish the three species.
